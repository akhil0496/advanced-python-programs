#### PROJECT1 : FOOD ORDER SYSTEM ####

The ```food Order System``` In Python is a simple project developed using Python. The project contains only the ```admin side```. The admin side manages all the ```orders```, ```payment process```, ```bill report```, and so on. Thus, this is a digital way of management of the meal order and also the payment system.

This is a simple console-base project which is very easy to understand and use. Also, this project makes a convenient way for any small restaurant to manage order lists, payment and keep the reports of payment in a digital way.
